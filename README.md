# DesktopGARP1.1.3
This repository provides the ecological niche modeling community with access to the DesktopGARP 1.1.3 Rule-set Writing and Mapping Application. This application runs the original 1.1.3 DesktopGARP version with the addition of writing the rule-sets from the experiment as a text file and producing a map for each model of how rules are applied to the landscape. These additional tools have been described in the literature in several papers:

McNyset, K. M. 2005. Use of ecological niche modelling to predict distributions of freshwater fish species in Kansas. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 14:243â€“255.

In this paper, freshwater fishes are predicted in streams and a complete rule-set from a single model is provided as an appendix
